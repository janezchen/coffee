    "Coffee is a relatable, lovable, two sided market. It serves as a cash crop for developing countries, providing a primary source of income for over 100 million people. In 2011 the coffee industry was valued at over 20 billion dollars, and coffee futures are traded on key finance exchanges every day alongside oil and gold. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coffee production occurs primarily in Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Columbia, with Brazil producing nearly twice as much coffee as Vietnam. Various beans are common to specific parts of the world, and hold different levels of value based on their perceived quality. Most of the worldâ€™s coffee industry, and therefore the price of coffee, is controlled by Kraft, Nestle, P&G, and Sara Lee. As one can see, there are a limited number of factors affecting the price of coffee as a commodity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Because coffee futures are publicly traded, there is a huge incentive to accurately model the future price of the good. Some of the factors worth considering are weather forecasting in countries of production, changes in demand, economics of export and import laws, and the price of raw materials. This information can be freely accessed and integrated into a predictive model."
